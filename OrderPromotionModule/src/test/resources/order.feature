  As a shopper
  I want the system to calculate my order total with applicable promotions
  So that I can understand how much to pay and what items I will receive

  Scenario: Multiple promotions stacked
    Given the threshold discount promotion is configured:
      | threshold | discount |
      | 1000      | 100      |
    And the buy one get one promotion for cosmetics is active
    When a customer places an order with:
      | productName | category  | quantity | unitPrice |
      | T-shirt     | apparel   | 3        | 500       |
      | 口紅          | cosmetics | 1        | 300       |
    Then the order summary should be:
      | originalAmount | discount | totalAmount |
      | 1800           | 100      | 1700        |
    And the customer should receive:
      | productName | quantity |
      | T-shirt     | 3        |
      | 口紅          | 2        |
